        <h2>This is me learning about Web Development.</h2>

        <p><li>And also my very first webpage, and here I will briefly introduce myself and my reasons to want to be an apprentice in this company.

        <h3>My Thoughts and Reasons on Learning Web Development:</h3>
        <p>
         <ol>
           <li> I have never done this before and I am finding it is a lot of fun!</li>
           <li> I have lots of family members and friends who are webdevs and I have always been interested in it.</li>
           <li> I would <em>love</em> to continuously learn and work in this field. <strong> So much to explore!</strong></li>  
           <li> As I spent a few years studying Biology in my homecountry of Brazil, curiosity is <em>definitely</em> a very strong characteristic of mine. It could potentially kill the cat, but also make him a successful developer, and hopefully me as well. </li>
           <li> Jokes aside, I admire the skill and art of coding very much. The behind the scenes of a beautifully crafted and programmed interface is always a pleasant thing to come across. I have heard great things about the company and would really appreciate being able to learn and work in such a nice environment.</li>
        </p>
        </ol>
